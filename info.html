			<p>
				Why was this made?
				<br>
				It started as a project for 6th sem. Now it is a part of your daily lives.
				<br><br>
				What does it do?
				<br>
				It is an automated login register for students. The students can now login and their attendance will be noted for their respective labs. The student can also view the days they have missed or attended the labs.
				<br><br>
				Has this been simple to do?
				<br>
				Not gonna lie, it took us some time to figure it out. But here we are with the results. :)

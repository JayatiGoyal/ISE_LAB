Automated login register system for ISE labs in RVCE

Labs are an integral part of the curriculum for undergrad engineering courses. There is a
significant need for proper management of the number of laboratories available, number of courses
that require the use of labs, and number of students from various semesters. The motivation behind
this project lies in making this entire system smoother and systematic. The aim is to automate the
process of managing login registers at ISE labs in RVCE.
